# 1D Hubbard-Model
Together with Lehmann representation of its Green function.
There are something needs attention.
1,Hubbard Matrix include periodization broad condition or not.
2,G matrix is not complete.Only electron with up spin is considered.
3,Lanczos will converge before reaching iteration time.
4,You don't need to calculate the whole Lanczos process for each point.
