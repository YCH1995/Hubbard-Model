# 1D Hubbard-Model
==================
Together with Lehmann representation of its Green function.
##There are something needs attention.
------------------------------------
1,Hubbard Matrix include periodization broad condition or not.<br>
2,G matrix is not complete.Only electron with up spin is considered.<br>
3,Lanczos will converge before reaching iteration time.<br>
4,You don't need to calculate the whole Lanczos process for each point.<br>
